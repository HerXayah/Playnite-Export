I figured that the strategy elements from those games would be exciting to blend with a MineSweeper format; something that may be familiar enough to most people, but novel enough to challenge new players. My aim was to create something casual and laid-back, while simultaneously appealing to more intense, competitive individuals who are seeking to improve their skills.<br><br>That being said, this is my first foray into game development. I'm a systems engineer by trade, and have never worked to build a video game (let alone a competitive online multiplayer one). However, after tinkering around in Unity (and several false-starts), BOMTILES slowly began to take shape. Before I knew it, my close friends were helping me test the game, giving me balance suggestions and other valuable feedback (thanks, guys!).<br><br>The next step is to get even more feedback from<strong>YOU!</strong><br><br>If you decide to download BOMTILES, I encourage you to hop into our Community Forums and post ideas, suggestions, and any issues you may experience with the game. I want BOMTILES to be a constantly evolving, community-driven title, and I'm very receptive to suggestions and constructive criticism.<br><br>I sincerely hope you enjoy playing BOMTILES as much as my friends and I do!</div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lozad/dist/lozad.min.js></script><script>const observer=lozad();observer.observe()</script>
