Remember – whether you send a group of soldiers on a sabotage mission or start a regular war – people will be watching your actions closely. Journalists, other politicians and leaders, justices, even common voters, they will all react to the situation. When an event occures, you can move troops, send nukes, declare a truce or try to maintain status quo – all of these action can be performed right from your office. What will you choose – peace or war? Make no mistake, the fate of the world rests on your shoulders.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201330/extras/steam_dialog_v1.gif?t=1640682481"><br>How should you respond – jokingly, seriously or ironically? Different options can help you make allies, but also enrage your previous supporters. Be careful with words and make sure that you don’t neglect any of the prominent groups or important people… or do and deal with the problems later.<br><br>Follow the narrative and react to events. Talk to your advisors, receive visitors and make decisions. There are no wrong answers... unless there are? Check for yourself and repeat the game if you fail – new dialogues await your discovery, so don’t worry about repetitiveness.

Screech about your plans, attitude, call somebody names or maybe praise the voters. It is entirely up to you how you want to come across in the internet – as funny, empathetic, factual or maybe weird?
