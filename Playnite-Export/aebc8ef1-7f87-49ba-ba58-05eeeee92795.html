Name's Blackwing by the way, I'm not exactly sure how I got this name, but hey, it's something, right? Anyway, I just left... the underground recently. Even as a devil it's all fire and brimstone down there, really not my style. Up here with all the earthlings it's so much nicer. Just gotta keep the evil inside in check, right? Can't be that hard.<br>It would be unimaginable if that part of me splits up, manifests as shadows, and causes havoc all over town. Can't happen. Nuh-uh.<br>It happened. Oh dear, Now I have to find someone with enough positive emotions, that can contain my glorious self, and help me defeat the shadow, so I can go back to my dreams of laziness. This plain office lady over there... Kureha, was it? She and her newfound friends will help me. Let's play pretend magical girl, kukuku.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1810000/extras/story2sm.png?t=1656071472"><h2 class=bb_tag>The Game</h2>Kuroi Tsubasa is a linear Visual novel with different paths to take.

Her big secret is that she is a fan of MeTubers and Idols - a fact that she keeps close to her heart, in fear of losing face.

His big dream is to laze around in the sun, on a patch of soft grass.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1810000/extras/puka.png?t=1656071472"><br>The spunky office lady, with a slightly mischievous streak. Puka loves all things retro, be it old manga or video games. She usually can be seen slacking off instead of working properly.<br>Puka is definitely the goofball of the group.

He recently arrived in town, to follow his dream: making good music, and opening the hearts of his listeners. However... he seems to have some troubles connecting with the people of this city.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1810000/extras/rurika.png?t=1656071472"><br>A cool beauty.

Egocentrical and abusive. Do not engage! Aside from that, he seems surprisingly diligent and proper, if he is not abusing his kouhais, that is.<br>Most people just see him as a bully, but maybe there's more beneath the surface. Probably not.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1810000/extras/alize.png?t=1656071472"><br>The totes kewl trendy gal from the local supermarket.
